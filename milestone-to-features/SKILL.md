# milestone-to-features

## Overview

Late binding: decompose exactly the current milestone, at planning time, never a future one. One milestone, one session. Features are written in execution order; order expresses dependency.

Scripts: `validate_roadmap.py` and `check_coverage.py` at `<this-skill-dir>/../prd-to-milestones/scripts/`; `session_tx.py` at `<this-skill-dir>/scripts/session_tx.py`.

## Preconditions (in order — stop at first failure)

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` succeeds. If it fails: stop; never run `git init`; tell the human to create the repository.
2. `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../prd-to-milestones/scripts/validate_roadmap.py ROADMAP.md` exits 0. If not: abort with the report; repair is a separate task.
3. `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../prd-to-milestones/scripts/check_coverage.py ROADMAP.md` exits 0. If not: abort; a stale partition must be reconciled by `prd-to-milestones` first.
4. Determine eligibility from the summary's current milestone state:

| State | Action |
|---|---|
| `planning-pending` | Decompose: write FEAT subsections, transition to `planned`. |
| `planned` (never started) | Re-decompose: delete every existing FEAT subsection and rewrite them in the same transaction; state stays `planned`. |
| `in-progress`, `paused`, `review-ready`, `remediating`, `accepted` | Refuse immediately. Name the state. Route to `review-milestone` or recovery via `execute-milestone`. Touch nothing. |
| `none` | Stop. Route to `prd-to-milestones`. |

## Propose-then-adjust

Read: the current milestone's `Goal:`, `Covers:`, and the covered REQ blocks from the PRDs; accepted ADRs that constrain implementation.

Apply all five sizing proxies and the count rule **before** presenting. Split any feature that violates a proxy:

1. One demonstrable behavior change.
2. 1–5 testable acceptance criteria.
3. Single subsystem.
4. No dependency on an open backlog entry.
5. Test plan statable upfront.

The natural feature count is counted **after** all proxy-mandated splits. Bundling several demonstrable behaviors into one feature to land at 10 or fewer violates proxy 1 and does not change the true count. If the natural count exceeds 10: stop immediately. Report the count, propose at least one concrete split seam (e.g., by functional domain), and name `prd-to-milestones` as the route to split the milestone. Leave `ROADMAP.md` byte-identical. Do not open a transaction.

Otherwise, present one complete ordered proposal: title, description, acceptance, test intent, and a one-line feature-to-REQ mapping with sizing rationale for each feature. Converge with the human before writing anything to disk.

## Feature template

Every feature is written exactly as:

```markdown
### FEAT-NNN — <title>

- Status: todo
- Description: <one sentence — what the agent builds>
- Acceptance: <1–5 testable bullets or a PRD-NNN REQ-NNN pointer>
- Test intent: <one line — how correctness is verified>
```

FEAT numbers are globally unique in the file; allocation is `max(live FEAT number) + 1`; `000` is illegal. Numbers freed by deleting a never-started FEAT set may be reused. The summary transitions with the milestone:

```markdown
- Milestone state: planned
- Next action: execute-milestone MS-NNN
```

(These live in `## Current Workflow Status`; update summary and milestone `State:` in the same commit.)

## Transaction recipe

1. `python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/session_tx.py begin`
2. `python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/session_tx.py track ROADMAP.md` — plus any backlog entries or ADR drafts (ADR drafts: via write-adr, `status: proposed`, never numbered or accepted here).
3. Write the FEAT subsections and the `planning-pending → planned` transition into `ROADMAP.md`.
4. Gate — all must exit 0 before proceeding; a failing artifact is never presented:
   - `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../prd-to-milestones/scripts/validate_roadmap.py ROADMAP.md`
   - `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../prd-to-milestones/scripts/check_coverage.py ROADMAP.md`
   - `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../write-prd/scripts/validate_backlog.py` over every manifest backlog entry
   - `python3 <this-skill-dir>/../write-adr/scripts/validate_adr.py` over every manifest ADR draft
5. `python3 <this-skill-dir>/scripts/session_tx.py preview` — pause for human review.
6. Approved → `session_tx.py approve -m "<msg>"`. Withheld → leave uncommitted, never abandon. Explicit abandon → `session_tx.py abandon`.

One commit, exactly the manifest files. Nothing committed unreviewed.

## Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| One milestone per session | Only the current milestone ever gains FEAT subsections. Later milestones remain feature-less regardless of how obvious their decomposition seems. |
| State transition | `planning-pending → planned` in the same commit as the FEAT subsections and summary update. Re-decomposition keeps `planned`. |
| Next action | `Next action: execute-milestone MS-NNN` — use the current milestone's ID. |
| FEAT allocation | `max(live)+1`; never reuse a live number; reuse after never-started deletion is legal. `000` illegal. |
| Count rule | 1–2 features: legal. Natural count (post-split) over 10: refuse, report seam, route to `prd-to-milestones`; ROADMAP untouched. |
| Scope boundary | Any change inside another milestone's span is forbidden. |
| Started milestones | Milestones in `in-progress`, `paused`, `review-ready`, `remediating`, or `accepted` state are untouchable — refuse and route, never plan. |
| Validator authority | Both tools exit 0 after writing, before preview. Passing validators cannot see an ineligible-state edit — **the state-eligibility table is the enforcement, not the validators**. |

## Red flags — STOP

- About to write FEAT subsections under any milestone other than the current one.
- About to decompose a future milestone because "it's tiny" or "we're already here" — authority and pragmatism do not override late binding.
- About to merge several behaviors into one feature so the count lands at 10 or fewer — bundling to duck the limit is the >10 signal; refuse.
- About to edit any field inside a started milestone (`in-progress`, `paused`, `review-ready`, `remediating`, `accepted`) — including FEAT rewrites — even if both validators exit 0 afterward.
- About to commit without a `preview` and explicit human approval.
- About to `git add -A` or stage any path outside the session manifest.
- About to run `git init`.

## Rationalization table

Each row quotes verbatim what a real agent said while violating a rule. Re-read the rule if your reasoning matches a pattern.

| Rationalization (verbatim) | Reality |
|---|---|
| "MS-002 got one feature: FEAT-004 — Refund flow (covers REQ-004). Both milestones are now `planned`." | MS-002 was not the current milestone. Decomposition is scoped to the current milestone only — authority plus pragmatism ("it's tiny") are not authorization. Its span stays byte-identical. |
| "The stale plan had FEAT-002 bundling two unrelated requirements — decline handling (REQ-002) and order history (REQ-003) — into a single feature with a single test intent. That coupling makes it impossible to ship or review them independently." | MS-001 was `in-progress`. The state-eligibility table is the enforcement; both validators exiting 0 does not authorize a commit. Route to `review-milestone` or recovery via `execute-milestone`; touch nothing. |
| "The 12 requirements clustered into 6 features by functional subsystem … all within the 1–10 count limit." | Each cluster bundled two demonstrable behaviors; proxy 1 splits them back to 12. Natural count over 10 → refuse, report the seam, route to `prd-to-milestones`; ROADMAP untouched. |
